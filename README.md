# Hello-World
First Github assignment for my Informatics course.
Hello,
My name is Ryan. I am 34 years old and have decided to re-enter the world of education to improve my job prospects and thus my quality of life. I love German Shepherds. 
There's nothing quite like having a furry companion! 
I enjoy hiking, biking, and swimming. I love to read, mainly history, alt history, sci-fi, and certain non-fiction topics. 
I also quite enjoy computer games. 
Getting a glimpse into the world of computers has been quite exciting!
